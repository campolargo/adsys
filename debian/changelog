    - user policies rely on the libpam-apparmor package which must be

      the adsys.yaml configuration file
  * Add a --machine / -m flag to adsysctl applied, indicating the policies

  * Add new types of GPOs support, with ubuntu advantage subscription
    integration. Recommends ubuntu-advantage-desktop-daemon.
  * Privilege escalation: support for privilege escalation and gives
    administrator access to users and groups registered in Active Directory.
    The administrator can also prevent any kind of local administrator on
    the machine.
  * Scripts integration: support for scripts in GPO when the computer boots and
    shuts down, and when the user logs on or off.
    - The computer scripts are ran as root, on startup (or first AD user login
      if we couldnât fetch GPOs and had no cache)
    - The user scripts are ran with systemd user session, as the user.
    - A transactional state is handled: New versions of scripts or list of
      scripts are only updated when a given session is not opened.
      Said differently, the shutdown scripts for the machine will be the ones
      downloaded and enabled when the start scripts were ran.
      Similarly, the user logoff scripts will be the ones corresponding to
      the time when the log on scripts were executed.
    - Any failing scripts wonât stop the boot or log on. Similarly to Windows
      script support, this is not a security feature.
  * Support downloading assets from the Active Directory server. Those assets
    are located in the <Distribution> named directory at SYSVOL root.
    Those needs a GPT.INI, similarly to GPO, to control cache update.
  * Internal changes on how policies and cached are handled. Those changes are
    needed to enhance the model of caching with assets, while keeping
    a transactional behaviour.
  * Many new tests covering all the new and existing changes.
  * General cleanups:
    - More debugging and info messages.
    - In templates, policies define personalized notes and descriptions.
      Those are now used to generate the description of the policy.
    - Modernize, fix bugs and workarounds now that we are on at min Go 1.16,
      and prepare for 1.17 and new vendored dependencies versions.
    - Add more linting support and fix discovered issues.
    - Rewrite integration tests containers mimicking system services in python
      for better reliability and support via dbus-mock. Upgraded to a newer
      version.
    - Adapt to new GitHub infrastructure changes with new container repository,
      and change workflows adjustements by new linting rules.
    - Discare deprecated dconf keys for those releases.
  * Updated vendored go dependencies:
    - bluemonday
    - cobra
    - color
    - glamour
    - go-dbus
    - golangci-lint
    - grpc
    - ini
    - viper

adsys (0.7.1) impish; urgency=medium

  * Fix user login name when being prefixed by domain (domain\user) or using
    default domain suffix.
  * Relax commands to always normalize to user@domain even if a previous form
    of entry is given
  * Fix pam module to always be loaded for those.
  * All users and machine update should not provide a target
  * Relax rule for hostname length when > 15 characters. Try first real name
    in AD and then fallback to 15 for NETBIOS compatibility if AD is configured
    in such a way.
  * Pull sss connection state dynamically, to switch between online and offline
    mode.
  * Misc smaller fixes in namings and entry permissive mode.
  * Add and adapt unit and integration tests for all the above, including
    docker test container.
  * Fixes for incoming Golang 1.17 tests Name() behaviour change
  * Make some integration tests more stable
  * Refresh policy definition file
  * Update vendored dependency via DEPENDABOT:
    - github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify
    - github.com/godbus/dbus
    - golang.org/x/text
    - google.golang.org/grpc
    - gopkg.in/ini.v1
    - honnef.co/go/tools
  * CI:
    - switch back to hirsute for QA code check, as impish docker images have
      a broken libc.
  * Packaging fixes:
    - Ensure we always build with PIE
    - Fix autopkgtests by not running them as root
    - Ship NOTICE from a vendor dependency as being Apache2 licensed
    - Modernize gbp.conf
